            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:207826:15"/> or given them a Power I refuse to use my Self; but expresly forbad them, and warn'd them in my Instructions of exercising any the least Revenge, Imposition or Coertion towards any: This is evident in my Sermon preached upon the Mount, where I freely, publickly and with much Plainness, not only <hi>prohibited Revenge,</hi> but <hi>injoyned Love to Enemies</hi> making it to be a great Token of true Discipleship to suffer <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44. 45, 46, 47.</note> Wrongs, and conquer Cruelty by Patience and Forgiveness, which is certainly a great Way off Imposition or Compulsion upon other Men. And when I was strongly bent for <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and sent Messengers before to prepare some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for me and my Company in a Village, belonging to the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and it seems the <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>At another Time one of my Disciples, relating to me some Passages of their Travails, told me of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Man they saw that cast out Devils in my <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 49, 50.</note> Name, and because he was not of their Company, nor followed them, said he, <hi>we forbad him;</hi> as if they had thereby served and pleased me; but I presently testified my Dislike of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Narrowness of their Zeal, and to inform them better told them, they should not have forbid him; <hi>for he that is not against us is for us;</hi> my Drift is not Opinion, but Piety; they that cast out Devils, convert Sinners, and turn Men to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, are not against me, nor the Nature and Religion of my Kingdom, and therefore ought to be cherisht rather then forbid. That I might sufficiently declare and inculcate my Mind in this Matter, I did at an other Time, and upon a different Occasion, preach against all Coertion and Persecution for Matters of Faith and Practice towards God, in my Parable of the Sower, as my
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:207826:15"/> Words manifest, which were these; <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a Man which sowed good Seed in his Field; but while Men slept, his Enemy came, and sowed Tares among the Wheat, and went his Way; but when the Blade sprung up, and brought forth Fruit, there appeared the Tares also; so the Servants of the House-houlder came and said, didst thou not sow good Seed in they Field? from whence then hath it Tares? he answered, an Eneny hath done this; the</hi>

                        <hi>Servants said unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? but he said NAY, lest while ye gather up the Tares, ye root up also the Wheat with them, let both grow together till the Harvest, and in the Time of Harvest I will say to the Reapers, gather ye together first the Tares, and bind them in Bundles to burn them, but gather the Wheat into my Barn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that I might not leave so necessary a Truth mis▪appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of my dear Followers, or liable to any Mis-constructions, my Disciples, when together, desiring an Explanation, I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted my Words thus;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He that soweth the good Seed is the Son of Man; the Field is the World; the good Seed are the Children of the Kingdom; but the Tares are the Children of the</hi>

                        <hi>Wicked One; the Enemy that sowed them is the Devil; the Harvest is the End of the World; and the Reapers are the Angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Patience, this Long-Suffering and great Forbearance belong to my Kingdom and the Subjects of it, my Doctrine speaks it, and my Example confirms it, and this can have no possible Agreement with Imposition and Persecution for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: And that I might sufficiently deter my Followers from any such Thing, as I profess my self to be their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, so have I commanded them to love one another in a more especial Manner; but if instead thereof <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 12.</note> any grow proud, high minded, and beat or abuse their Fellow Servants in my religious Family, when I come to take account of my Houshold, he shall be cut asunder, and appointed his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the Unbelievers; behold the Recompence I appoint to Imposing Lordly Persons, such as count others Infidels, and to make them such Believers as themselves, will exercise Violence
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:207826:16"/> towards them, and if they prevail not, will call for Fire from Heaven to devour them, and if Heaven refuse them, will fall a beating and killing, and think (it may be they do God good Service) but their Lot shall be with Unbelievers forever: Nay, I have so effectually provided against all Mastery, that I expresly charged them, <hi>not to be many Masters; for one was their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi> I told them, that <hi>the greatest amongst them was to be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the rest,</hi> not to impose upon the rest; nay, that to be great in my Kingdom, they must become as gentle and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less as little Children, and such cannot force and punish in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, In fine, I strictly commanded them, to love one another, as I have loved them, who am ready to lay down my Life for the Ungodly, instead of taking away Godly Mens Lives for Opinions; and this is the great Maxim of my holy Religion, <hi>He that would be my Disciple, must</hi> not crucifie other Men, but <hi>take up his Cross, and follow me, who am meek and lowly,</hi> and such so enduring shall find Eternal Rest to their Souls, this is the Power I use, and this is the Power I give.</p>
                     <p>How much this agrees with the Language, Doctrine and Example of Jesus Christ, I shall leave them to consider, that read and believe Scripture; but some affected to present Church▪ Power, and desiring their Ruine that conform not to her Worship and Discipline, will object, That Christ did give his Church Power to bind and loose, and bid any Person agrieved tell the Church.</p>
                     <p>I grant it; but what Binding was that? with outward Chains and Fetters, in nasty Holes and Dungeous? nothing less: Or was it, that his Church had that true Discerning in her, and Power with him, that what she bound, that is condemned, or loosed, that is remitted, should stand so in God's Sight and Christ's Account.</p>
                     <p>But tell the Church; and what then? observe Christ's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the Punishment of the Offender; <hi>If the Offender will neither receive private Admonition, nor hear the Church, then</hi> (sayes Christ) <hi>let him be to thee as an</hi> Heathen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here's no Fines, Whips, Stocks, Pillories, Goals, and the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:207826:16"/> of Cruelty, to punish the Heretick; for the Purport of his Words seems to be no more then this; If any Member of the Church refuse thy private Exhortation and the Church's Admonition, look upon such a Person to be no more of you; let him take his Course, thou hast done well, and the Church is clear of him.</p>
                     <p>Well, but say the <hi>Church-Fighters</hi> of our Age, <hi>Did not</hi> St. Paul <hi>wish them cut off that troubled the Church in his Time?</hi> Yes: But with what Sword think you? Such as Christ bid <hi>Peter</hi> put up, or the Sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God? Give him leave to explain his own Words; <hi>For the WEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PONS of our Warfare are NOT CARNAL, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of strong Holds, casting down Imaginations, and every high Thing that exalteth it self against the Knowledge of God, and bringing every Thought into Obedience to Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What think you of this? Here are Warfares, Weapons, Oppositions and Conformity, and not only no external Force about Matters of Religion us'd or countenanced, but the most express and pathetical Exclusion and Rejection of any such Thing that could be given.</p>
                     <p>Now observe what Sort of Church-Government he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to his beloved <hi>Timothy; Avoid foolish Questions, and Genealogies, and Contentions, and striving about the Law, for they are unprofitable and vain: A Man that is an Heretick, after the first and second Admonition, reject, knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth, being</hi> CONDEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NED OF HIMSELF, <hi>or self-condemned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's very remarkable; <hi>first,</hi> That this great Apostle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of exhorting <hi>Timothy</hi> to stand upon Niceties, and sacrifice Mens Natural Comforts and Enjoymnets for Opinions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, injoyns him to shun Disputes about them, leaving Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their own Thoughts and Aprehensions in those Matters, which excellently well coheres with another Passage of his; <hi>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded, and if in any Thing ye be otherwise mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>

                        <hi>God shall</hi> REVEAL <hi>even this unto you;</hi> he did not say, you shall be FINED, PILLAGED, EXCOMMUNICATED and FLUNG into Prison, if ye be not of our Mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2dly,</hi> That, in the Apostles Definition, an Heretick is a self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned Person, one conscious to himself of Error, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy in it; but that are not conscientious Dissenters; for many Ten Thousands in this Nation act as they believe, and dissent from the National Religion, purely upon a Principle of Conscience to Almighty God; and with Men of any Tenderness or common Sense, their continual great Sufferings in Person and Estate, and their Patience under them, are a Demonstration, or there can be none in the World: Nor can their Persecutors disprove them, unless they could search Hearts, and that is a little too far for a Fallible Spirit to reach, and an Infallible One they deny: So that the Apostle makes not the Heretick to lye upon the Side of mis-believing, or not coming up to his Degree of Faith &amp; Knowledge, but upon the Side of Wilfully, Turbulently, Obstinately and Self-condemnedly maintaining inconsisting Things with the Faith, Peace and Prosperity of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Granting us then not to be obstinate and self-condemned Dissenters (and you cannot reasonably refuse it us) how do you prove us Erroneous in the other Part? All Parties plead Scripture, and that for the most opposite Principles; <hi>Homousians</hi> and <hi>Arrians, Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Arminians, Papists, Jansenists</hi> and <hi>Protestants;</hi> The Scripture, you see, cannot determine the Sense of it self; it must have an Interpreter; he must either be Fallible or Infallible; If the first, we are worse then before; for Men are apt to be more confident, and yet are still upon as uncertain Grounds; If the last, this must either be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or an Internal Judge: If an External, you know where you are without pointing; for there stands nothing between you and Popery in that principle; If an Internal Judge, either it is our selves, or the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us; Not our selves; for then the Rule is the Thing ruled, which cannot be; and if it be the Spirit of Christ Jesus (and the Apostle tells us, <hi>That unless we have the Spirit we are none of Christ's)</hi> then is the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:207826:17"/> Neck of Imposition broken, and what hast thou to do to judge me? let me stand or fall to my own Master; And upon this Foot went <hi>Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, Beza</hi> abroad; And <hi>Cranmer, Ridly, Hooper, Jewel, Bradford, Philpot, &amp;c.</hi> at home, and as good Men, and constant Martyrs in Ages before them.</p>
                     <p>But suppose Conscientious Dissenters as ill Men as the Apostle describes an Heretick to be; what is the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>3dly, A Man that is an Heretick, after the first and second Admonition reject,</hi> that is, deny his Communion, declare he is none of you, condemn his Proceedings by a publick Censure among your selves; what more can be strain'd by the fiercest Prosecutors of Men for Religion out of these Words.</p>
                     <p>But was this the Evangelical Rule and Practice? Yes, that it was; Oh then whence comes Imposition Force Cruelty, Spoil of Goods, Imprisonments, Knockings, Beatings, Bruisings, Stockins, Whippings, and Spilling of Blood for Religion? What Church is that, whose Officers are so far from cloathing the naked, as to strip the clothed, from feeding the hungry, that they take their Bread from them, and those poor Widdows and helpless Orphans too; and so remote from visiting the sick and imprisoned, that they drag away their Bed from under them, and cast People into Prison for Conscience sake; Nay they haled away an Honest Man from a Meeting to Goal at <hi>Reading,</hi> (but the other Day) not permitting him to TAKE LEAVE of his poor Wife, newly delivered, and in a DYING Condition, though she also desired it, and liv'd but just by the Meeting-House where they took him. In fine, what are they that for no other Cause pass such dreadful Excommunications, as render the Excommunicants little better then outlawed Persons, subjecting their Civil and Natural Rights to their Pride, Passion, Interest or Revenge, unless they will purchase their Enjoyment at the dear Rate of loosing their own Souls? For what else can be the Consequence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:207826:18"/> of conforming to that I do not believe? Is not this to destroy sincere Men, and make and save Hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>Oh, that such as are concern'd would soberly consider, if any Thing is so Scandalous to True Religion as FORCE; who can think that evidence Good that is extorted? And what a Church is that, which is made up of such Proselites, or that employes such Means to make them? O where is that <hi>Christian</hi> Meekness, Patience and Forbearance? How many have been ruined, that were never exhorted, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunicated before they were once admonished? This is not to serve God, but Worldly Interest: its quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Christ's Counsel and Doctrine: He came to save, and not to destroy Nature to magnifie his Grace. You pretend to hate <hi>J. Calvin</hi>'s unconditional Reprobation, yet practise it; If you say no, Conformity is your Condition: I answer, that its as unreasonable to require an impossibillity, as cruel to damn Men for not doing it; For as you say, his Doctrine makes God to command them to repent, that cannot repent, and yet damn them if they repent not; So you injoyn Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish their present Faith and Worship, and conform to yours, which is not in their Power to do, yet damn them in a temporal Respect if they refuse it; For you make such an unavoidable Dissent, punishable with the Destruction of Mens Liberties and Estates: You had better leave off va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing your selves upon the Mercy and Well-Natur'dness of that Tenet of the universal Love of God to Mankind, till you love more then your selves, and abominate the Church of England's being, such an Elect to the Civil Government as utterly reprobates the rest, as you pretend to detest the like Injustice in <hi>J Calvin</hi>'s Notion of Election and Reprobation.</p>
                     <p>And the Truth of it is, this helps on <hi>Atheism</hi> as much as any Enormity in the Land, when Witty Men, not willing to take Pains to examine after the Truth and Excellency of Religion, behold Men that call themselves Christ's Ministers, and the Apostles Successors and Followers, to affect and seek Government, and yet twice deny it, when they go to receive it, that some others grow Lordly, live Voluptuously, and watch
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:207826:18"/> after the biggest Preferments; not being excited by most Service for God, but Earthly Power and Wealth for themselves, and at the same Time persecuting Men of more Self-Denyal, for Matters of Opinion about Faith and Worship towards God; so that <hi>No Conformity</hi> to this Church, <hi>No Protection</hi> from the State. Which among <hi>Protestants</hi> is so much the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, because they by these Courses implicitely own and assume the highest Infallibility and Perfection, and yet deny any such Thing; For it supposes that nothing is Truer, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Perfecter, or else they both persecute Men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a Fallible and Imperfect Religion, and with cruel Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties provide against any Thing more True or Infallible; the greatest Injury to the World that can be; for it is a plain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to frustrate all those excellent Prophesies and gracious Promises God has given, and the holy Scriptures declare of the latter Dayes. To conclude, I shall desire Men of this Unnatural, Unreasonable and Unchristian Spirit to consider:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What Church was that which <hi>John</hi> saw, riding upon the Powers of the Earth, employing their Authority to force CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FESSION, TRIBUTE and SUBJECTION to her?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What that Church was which dyed her self in the BLOOD of them that believed not in her, against whom the poor Souls under the Altar (whose Bodies had been beheaded by her) cryed to God?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What Church it was that would suffer none to Buy, Sell or Traffick without having her <hi>Mark</hi> (CONFORMITY to her) in their Forehead or right Hand, that is, either those that heartily and openly confest her, or those that basely complyed for Fear?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What Church is that which Trades in the Souls of Men? Read <hi>Revelations. Chap.</hi> 13. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Whether this Church reigns not, wherever Mens,

                        <hi>LIBERTIES</hi> and <hi>PROPERTIES,</hi> with all the Comforts of this Life are exposed and sacrificed for Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>FAITH</hi> and <hi>WORSHIP</hi> to Almighty God.</p>
                     <p>Weigh these Things, you great Church-Men of the Age, in the Fear of that God who made Heaven and Earth, and think not to make thus cheap of the Lives, Liberties and Estates of <hi>Free-born English People, and Harmless Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians for their peaceable Conscience,</hi> without being accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that Great Lord in the <hi>Terrible</hi> Day of his Judgment, that draws on upon the World: No Plea you have shall be able to justifie these things, or fence off the heavy Stroak of that Just Judge, unless you repent: 'Tis not Succession in Name, but Nature, that makes the true Christian Minister and Bishop: And where the Divine Life and Holy Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of Christ and his Apostles are wanting, there can be no Succession, but what is as proper to the false Church as the true, the Counterfeit as the Christian: <hi>Be not deceived, God will not be mocked, such as you Sow, such shall you Reap.</hi> Remember Christ's Words; <hi>Blessed are the Poor in Spirit; for theirs is the Kingdom of God. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the Pure in Heart; for they shall see God. Blessed are the Meek; for they shall in her it the Earth. Blessed are the MERCIFƲL; for they shall obtain Mercy.</hi> Therefore Reform, and let your Moderation be known unto all Men, for the Lord is at hand: <hi>Even so come Lord Jesus.</hi>

                  <p>ON the 20th of the 6th moneth, 1676. the People of God being met together at their Meeting-house, being in the Subburbs of the City of <hi>Hereford</hi> to worship the God of Heaven according to their usual manner, in Spirit and in Truth, one <hi>John Rea</hi> (as they heard) went and informed <hi>Henry Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicott,</hi> then Mayor of the City, of the Meeting, who with several other Officers came unto the Meeting and after some words warned them, <hi>not to meet any more,</hi> and said, <hi>if they did, let it be at their Peril,</hi> and so went away.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 27th of the same moneth, they being in like manner peaceably Assembled together again, there came unto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:207826:26"/> them many Boyes out of the City in a Riotous manner, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stones and Dirt into the Meeting.</p>
                  <p>On the 3d of the 7th Moneth next after, being also the first day of the Week, they were peaceably met again to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, then came Boyes, and Girles, and Young People to a great number, in the same Riotous manner, and throng'd in and about the Meeting. and became so abusive unto them beyond all Humanity, so as to fling their Hats at their Faces, using all the filthy deriding words towards them they could invent to utter, and with their Staves some of them would strike off many of their Hats off their Heads, of both Men and Women, and sometimes striking some upon their Heads with their Staves, and sometimes justling against them, and throwing Stones amongst them, and brake some of the Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windows, and turned in Dogs into the Meeting, oftentimes bidding them <hi>speak by the spirit,</hi> and then making a Noise with <hi>Hooping</hi> and <hi>Hollowing;</hi> and some of them fastened Burs to some of the Men's Hair; and as they sought to force a Pig into the Meeting amongst them, it happening to be a Pig of <hi>John Rea's,</hi> who on that day two Weeks before was said to inform the Mayor of the Meeting, and he seeking to drive his own Pig from them, one of the unruly Young Men broke his Head with a Stone, which was the new-elected Mayor's Son, as 'twas said.</p>
                  <p>On the next first Day being the 10th of the 7th Moneth, the aforesaid People were again assembled together in their usual religious Manner, and in a short Space the Street before the House, became filled with People, young &amp; old; &amp; many young Men and Boyes came in upon them, riotously as before, and threw their Hats at and amongst them, and fired Squibs, and threw amongst them, and then throwing Stones against the Glass Windows, stroke a Woman, as she was sate within the Room, on the side of her Head with a Stone: But seeing them so outragious, and desperately cruel, some of the Meeting went to the <hi>Mayor</hi> to signifie their Doings unto him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came somewhat displeased at the Matter, and also they went to

                     <hi>Abraham Seward</hi> an Attorney at Law, the New Elected <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> whose Son was one of the Leaders of the turbulent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in their Actings, to acquaint him of his Son, who seemed to be ignorant of his Son's Doings, yet somewhat threatned the Persons that went to him, with the Execution of the Law upon them; &amp; because some of the Lads belonged to the Free-School in <hi>Hereford,</hi> one of the Meeting went to the chief Master of the School about them, who presently came and took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of as many as he could find; for many of them dispersed at his coming, they having by that time beaten the Glass-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to pieces with Stones and Staves; but it was said by some, he was forbidden to correct them, and that the Colledge-Priests should set them on, and say, they would bear them out in what they did; and some of the unruly Boyes were <hi>Quire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 14th Day of the 7th Moneth they were peaceably met together again to serve the living God, and assoon as they departed many rude Boyes came running to find them there, and some of them said, if they had met with them, they would have done their work for them, and fell again upon the glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windows breaking them.</p>
                  <p>On the 16th Day following two Friends went to <hi>Robert Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> and <hi>Thomas Simonds,</hi> Justices for the City, to let them know of the several riotous Assemblies, and the Abuses done upon them, who not at all regarded their Complaint, but the said <hi>Robert Simonds</hi> did endeavour to force some Confession of a Meeting from one of them, and then protested, if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, he would immediately have fined him; then the Friend asked him, what if it should please God to suffer another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be set up with Authority in this Nation, would he not think it an unreasonable thing to be forced from, or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Religion he now professeth? He answering said, he should not, but would be subject to the Government; and after said to some others, as we were credibly informed, that if the Friend had but confessed a Meeting, he would presently have arrested his Horses he had then in the Town; and also said, the <hi>Quakers</hi> were well helpt up to come with Complaints to them.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:207826:27"/>
                  <p> On the 17th Day after, it being the first Day of the Week, the aforesaid People were peaceably assembled again to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, after some time the rude Company of Boyes &amp; young People came unto them in the former riotous manner; many of them having Sticks and Staves in their Hands, and they threw their Hats, and Dirt, and Stones amongst them, and Squibs, and burned some of their Clothes; and when Friends departed, the Door of the House being locked, they passing away, saw the Master of the School coming hastily again to seek after his Schollars, which many of them perceiving, hid themselves from him, and he said unto Friends, that it was not fitting that Boyes should be suffered to abuse them as they did, yet soon after the rude Company became more unruly then before; for they totally brake down the Glass-Windows that remained, and as many of the Pillars thereof as they could, with some of the Walls of the House, and entered in and broke the Benches and Seats they found therein; and brake open an inner Door with other things they could meet with; and some Boyes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after some Friends of the Countrey with hooping and hollowing, and throwing of Stones after them, about a quarter of a Mile; and it was commonly said, that the Master of the School going about to correct some of his Schollars for their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses towards Friends, they made such a Resistance against him, as violently to throw him over a Bench, and giving him threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Words, they being so emboldned in ill Practices; and when several sober People of the City, that saw or heard of the Doings of the rude Company, crying out against them, they would threaten them; and one man, because he reproved them, was forced to take up Stones in his Hands to defend himself from them</p>
                  <p>The 18th Day of the 7th Moneth, 1676 there being a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Hereford</hi> of the aforesaid People, to enquire into the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the poor, the Widows and Fatherless Children, that they that are able to work may be imployed, and assisted to get their own livelihood, but if unable, then to be relieved, and the Fatherless and Helpless Children to be set out Apprentices, which is acceptable Service to God, and great Benefit to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:207826:27"/> whole Nation, against which work there is no Law, nor ought to be; for it is the Command of God, <hi>To do good unto all, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially to the Houshold of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in Obedience to God and his Truth they came together to do this especial Good to the Houshold of Faith, and being peaceably met together in their shattered Meeting House, and after some time was spent in the Service of Truth, there came a great Company of rude tumultuous Boyes, many of them in a Riotous Manner with Staves, Sticks and long Splints of Wood in their Hands, and surrounding the House, and one of them sounding a Horn, there came a great Company of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of several Sorts; then the Boyes began to throw their Hats, Dirt and Stones into the Meeting, and hurt some; and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abominable, filthy, reviling Words and deriding Speeches against the Spirit of God, and his Worship; one of them came within the Door, and breaking Wind backward said, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit moved him,</hi> and so the brutish rude Company fell to laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And a Friend in the Meeting seeing their Wickedness, was constrained to bear his Testimony against them, exhorting Friends to Patience, and the tumultuous rude Company to Moderation (who like the <hi>Sodomites</hi> about just <hi>Lot</hi>'s House, encompassed them about in their cruel Emnity) lest the Lord bring some sweeping Judgement upon them and the City.</p>
                  <p>Then soon after came some of the Magistrates of the City, namely <hi>Edward King</hi> and <hi>Robert Simonds</hi> Justices, with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Seward</hi> the Elected Mayor for the Year to come, an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney at Law, whose Coming was not at all to appease and scatter the Riot and Rage of the People, but to execute their own and the Priests Envy and Cruelty against Friends, which first appeared in the Boyes and rude Multitude, and then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:207826:28"/> it self in their Proceedings; The said <hi>Edward King</hi> Justice, first entring the House, said in a vain, light, scoffing Spirit, <hi>What be ye? Quakers, or Shakers, or Candlestick-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers?</hi> And then asked, who was the Speaker? some of the Boyes said, such a one; then <hi>Abraham Seward</hi> with the two Justices urged him to take the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and did the like to the rest of the men, taking their Names, with the Names of the Women, and then calling for the Constables and other Officers to take the Men to Prison, being eight in Number, and threatned to fine the Women with him that the Boyes said, spake, and for the House also; then they took away the eight Men to the <hi>Town-Hall</hi> or Market House, and in their Passage along with the Magistrates, <hi>Abraham Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Elected Mayor said, <hi>They should never meet there,</hi> and had often spake it before, and words to that Purpose in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And a Friend going with him said, <hi>We are a People gathered by the Power of the Lord, and therefore the Power of Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not scatter us:</hi> Then he replyed, and said, <hi>I will break your Meetings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then they came to the Town hall, and there they tendred the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy</hi> to them, who answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, said, <hi>We are</hi> Christians, <hi>therefore cannot break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ to swear at all; but to render just and lawful Allegiance to the King, do not deny nor refuse.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this their Answer, they made a Mittimus, and sent them to prison.</p>
                  <p>About the next day after they were imprisoned, one <hi>Walter Rogers</hi> a Prebend walking by the Meeting house, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how it was broken and torn with the Rude Company, said to some as he passed, <hi>That they were Very Good Boyes, and had done their Works Better then he thought they had.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 24th of the 7th moneth, being the first day of the Week, Friends were assembled again to wait upon God, many Rude Boyes came unto them, and threw their Hats at them, one of them pulling a Woman by her Chin, and poch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friends with their Staves through the Windows; and when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:207826:28"/> Friends departed, many of the Boyes followed some of them a pretty way, throwing Stones after them, using many Taunting and Deriding VVords against God's Holy Spirit and Worship.</p>

                     <p>Where many of the People of God, in Scorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> came to appeal for Justice from the Illegal Proceedings of the Cruel Informers, who acted by Virtue of several Warrants granted forth by <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi> Justice of the Peace; there being about 20 Appeals which were promised to be tried at this Sessions, and but three of them put in, the manner of their Trials was as followeth, as near as can be remembred.</p>
                     <p>Upon the 8th day of the 11th Mo as afore-said, the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:207826:51"/> sate the Council for the Informers spoke to the Justices and the rest of the Court, that <hi>it would be a Dishonour to the King, and to his Honourable Justices of Peace, that the Appeals should be tried; for if they were, it was as much as if the Iustices had not done according to Law, and if it should be brought in for the Appellant, it would be a Dishonour to them,</hi> or Words to that Effect.</p>
                     <p>The Council for the Appellant, <hi>It is not any Dishonour to the King, or his</hi> Justices, <hi>but whether the Informers acted according to Law or no, that is the Question; and if any look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be grieved contrary to Law, they may be tried by a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of twelve men, which the Law doth allow;</hi> and further, he desired the Tryals might be in the Informers Name, and not in the Name of the King, but it would not be granted. So when the Justices had ordered the Appeals should go on to Tryal, a Jury was impannelled and sworn, and the Warrant of <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi>'s Conviction of the Meeting at <hi>Blythe</hi> such a Day, betwixt the King of the one Part, and <hi>Iohn Sayton</hi> and the other Appellants on the other part, by which Warrant the said <hi>Iohn Sayton</hi> was fined 20 l. for suffering a Conventicle at his House (as they said) in the Parish of <hi>Blythe.</hi> So the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses were called and sworn.</p>
                     <p>Witness, <hi>I was there on that Day, and there were several People met, but were all silent, and no Words spoken amongst them but did not see Iohn Sayton there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Council for the Appellant,</hi> Now in the first place, forasmuch as there was neither Preaching, Praying nor Reading, as their own witness doth testifie, therefore it was no Conventicle.</p>
                     <p>2dly, Being they cannot prove he was there, therefore how can it be judged, that he did either wittingly or willingly consent to that Meeting, if they could make it a Conventicle, with much more to that purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Informers Council,</hi> Now as to the first, although there was neither Preaching, praying nor Reading, yet it was evident enough that they met under a pretence of a Religious Exercise, &amp; seeing there was more then five, &amp; not of <hi>Iohn Sayton</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore it must needs be a Conventicle. And as to the 2d,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:207826:51"/> seeing they cannot prove he was there, we must leave it to the Consciences of the Jury, whether he did willingly consent to that Meeting, or no.</p>
                     <p>So when the Council had spoke on both sides, <hi>Peniston Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> one of the Justices, who sate in the Chair, as Judge of the Court, stood up and spoke to the Jury to this Effect, and said, <hi>Although there was no visible Exercise that can be proved, yet the</hi> Quakers <hi>say, they worship God in Spirit and Truth, and we know their Manner is, to sit sighing and groaning, and such like dumb Actions;</hi> and did very much labour to insense the Jury (not like an Impartial Judge) and told them, <hi>They must find it for the King;</hi> and so the Jury went forth in Order to bring in a Verdict.</p>
                     <p>So another Jury was impannelled, in Order to a second Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of <hi>Iohn Sayton</hi>'s, he being sined 20 l. more for a Meeting in the parish of <hi>Blythe</hi> as aforesaid; so the Witnesses being sworn, their proceedings were much like the former, only one passage is to be taken Notice of, concerning one <hi>Thomas Sharp</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, who not long before did forswear himself before a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Peace in the County, and Evidence being ready in the Court upon his Oath to testifie the same, in Order to invalidate hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Evidence, was called to know what he could say concerning <hi>Sharp,</hi> but the informers Council would not suffer him to speak to that Matter, but instead thereof, asked the Witness several ensnaring Questions, and <hi>Sharpe</hi>'s Testimony was taken.</p>
                     <p>Counsellor <hi>Leake</hi> being for the Appellant, asked the said <hi>Thomas Sharpe, VVhether he was to have part of the Fine by the Oath he had taken?</hi> and he said, <hi>Nay:</hi> He was then asked, <hi>VVhat he did at</hi> Blythe <hi>that day, and what was his Business?</hi> and he answered, <hi>To look after Meetings.</hi> So this we leave to sober People, to judge whether he was concerned or nay, he being one of the Informers.</p>
                     <p>Note also, That <hi>Iohn Sayton</hi> was above Sixty Miles from home the same day that he was fined 20 l. as was made appear in open Court by substantial Evidence.</p>
                     <p>So the Jury went forth, and the first Jury immediately came in with a Verdict.</p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:207826:52"/>
                     <p> Then they were asked, <hi>If they were all agreed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Jury, And they said, <hi>Yes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Court, <hi>VVho shall speak for you?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Jury, <hi>Our Fore-man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Court, <hi>Do you find it for the King or for the Appellant?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Jury, <hi>For the Appellant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this Verdict coming in, <hi>Penistone VVhaley,</hi> one of the Justices (the rest of them being pretty moderate) bid them <hi>Go forth again;</hi> but one of the Jury-men stood up &amp; said, <hi>They were agreed, and they had considered it very well;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fell into a great Rage, and flung off the Bench, and said, <hi>You deserve all to be Hanged,</hi> and said, <hi>they were as ill as Highway-men,</hi> and Cursed them, and further said, as if <hi>He hoped the King would take away Iuries, for this way will not do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then Lawyer <hi>Athrop,</hi> the Appellant's Atturney, answered and said to the Court, <hi>You know how Iudges have been reproved for threatning Iuries, and striving to force them contrary to their Consciences,</hi> or words to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>So the second Jury came in, and was asked, <hi>If they were agreed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They said, <hi>Yes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Court, <hi>Do you find it for the King or the Appellant?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Jury, <hi>For the Appellant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Verdict was to the great Satisfaction of most peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who had heard or known of the Informers Cruelty and Ungodly Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>Upon the nineth day, being the next Morning, the Court sate, again, and proceeded in order to a Tryal of <hi>VVilliam Hudson</hi>'s of <hi>Little-Greenley,</hi> near <hi>Redford,</hi> for which he stood convicted by <hi>Robert Thoroton,</hi> and fined 20 l. and <hi>VVilliam Hudson</hi> was called, and did appear, and was bidden to come up to the Bar, but as he was coming up, one pulled off his Hat, and <hi>Penistone VVhaley</hi> seeing that, bid <hi>give the man his Hat again,</hi> so <hi>VVilliam</hi> put it upon his Head, and for so doing <hi>P. VVhaley</hi> fined him 5 l. and committed him to Prison, and said, <hi>VVe need no Iury for that.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:207826:52"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That these two former Juries were impannelled by the Sheriff according to Law, being all substantial Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exception when they were sworn, and only intended to try the Causes depending; but the judicious Care of the Jury men not suting the Humour of some of the Justices in bringing in their Verdicts the day before, must now all be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off, and to work they go to impannel a new Jury to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer their Ends; and one <hi>Billige</hi> was called and placed the Fore-man, which is or hath been Bailiff to <hi>P. VVhaley,</hi> and one <hi>Howett</hi> that is his Clark, and others whom they pleased. So the Jury being sworn, and the Witnesses also, which were two Informers, viz. <hi>Thomas Sharpe</hi> and <hi>Obadiah Anthony,</hi> and another poor man, which did say, <hi>VVe saw many people met together about sixteen, but they were silent, without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any words; but they could not say, they saw</hi> William Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>there. Thomas Sharpe</hi> was asked, <hi>If he knew</hi> William Hudson? and he said, <hi>Yea, and that is he,</hi> pointing at one, of which several took notice of him, <hi>VVilliam Hudson</hi> being then in Prison [A Notorious Forsworn Informer.]</p>
                     <p>The Appellant's Council seeing their Illegal Proceedings in impannelling another Jury, whom they pleased, and would not admit of any Exception, nor have regard to Law, would plead no more, but did forthwith rise up, and said, <hi>If this be your Law, I have done,</hi> or words to that purpose.</p>
                     <p>But the Informers Council made use of his Silence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to their own unjust Ends, &amp; wronged him, saying to the Jury, <hi>You are upon the Matter of Fact, and you see the Case is so clear that their Council hath nothing to say; therefore you need not stand long about it, but bring it in for the King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the Jury went out, but notwithstanding their illegal choice of them, in hopes of a speedy and free Verdict to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer their Ends, yet it proved far otherwise, as will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the sequel.</p>
                     <p>For after they had waited a long while, and the Jury came not in, they sent a Bailiff to know <hi>if they were agreed?</hi> then he returned and said, <hi>They are not agreed, and they think they shall not agree.</hi>

                     <p> So when they had waited very long, and had done their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Business, they sent again to them, <hi>That if they would have Information in matter of Law, they would inform them:</hi> So the Bailiff brought them into the Court, and <hi>Penistone Whaley</hi> said, <hi>Are you agreed?</hi> and <hi>Billidge</hi> the Foreman said, <hi>We are Eight that would bring it in for the King, and there are Four that will not agree thereto.</hi> Penistone Whaley, <hi>Why, what Four are these that will not agree?</hi> One of them stood up and said, <hi>In the first place, I am not satisfied that</hi> William Hudson <hi>did wittingly and willingly consent to the Meeting at his House; and 2dly, there being neither preaching nor pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor any visible Exercise of Religion, it cannot be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Informers Atturney said, <hi>That as concerning it being a Conventicle, the</hi> Quakers <hi>themselves did grant, and several of them that wtre at that Meeting had paid their Fine.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> This was false; for none that were at that Meeting had paid any Fines; but by virtue of <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi>'s War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Officers and Informers had taken their Goods, and because they did not put in their Appeals, this is called a Confession of the Fact.</p>
                     <p>And so they went out again, but could not agree, and about Eight by the Clock at Night one of the four being weak, and ill of a Cold, and wanting Refreshment, something condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, partly through the Threats of <hi>Penistone Whaley,</hi> threatning them, who said, <hi>If they could not agree, there they were likely to stay until they dy'd, and as one dyed they would chuse another, until they were all Dead.</hi>

                     <p>But the Justices told them, <hi>It was not lawful to do it, but was a Cheat to the King, and a Dissembling with God Almighty.</hi> But the Appealant's Atturney desiring to prove the Lawfulness of it, was threatned to be <hi>Bound to his Good Behaviour if he spoke any thing before the Verdict was delivered in open Court.</hi> So at last they were forced again to condiscend, and the Verdict was given in against the Appealant, although it was contrary to their Consciences, being Forced thereunto, as some of them declared in open Court, and to this day some of them remain dissatisfied.</p>
                     <p>So the Court being now sate at <hi>Newark,</hi> and a Jury im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelled in order for another Tryal of <hi>William Hudson,</hi> he being the Appealant, the Goaler gave <hi>William Hudson</hi> leave to be there.</p>
                     <p>The Jury being now impannelled, <hi>Pen.

                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi> (another of the Justices) said, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>Worship is with Sighs and Groans which cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereupon one of the Jury-men desired to be satisfied, for said he, <hi>It may be they met not to worship God, but were sate Sighing and Mourning for their Abominations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi> replyed, <hi>That's the</hi> Quakers <hi>Worship, the Wickedest Thing in the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But said the Man, <hi>I would gladly do Equity.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi> replyed, <hi>YOƲ HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH</hi>

                     <p>So they went out, and some of the Jury being not satisfied concerning the Meeting, being it was in Silence, did think to have found it for the Appealant, as they have confessed; but presently they procured one <hi>Obadiah Anthony,</hi> an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who told them, <hi>That there was Preaching, and they were kneeled down upon their Knees:</hi> So then they concluded against the Appealant.

                     </p>
                     <p>Also, when <hi>John Sayton</hi>'s Appeal was tryed at <hi>Newark,</hi> the Foreman of the Jury, <hi>William Arnall</hi> by name of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couson (Robert Thorton</hi>'s Neighbour) did much Rail in the Court against the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and one heard him say, <hi>I will serve the</hi> Quakers <hi>turn this time; we will be troubled with them no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Several that were called upon the Jury they excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and shewed no Cause why, and would have none but such as were ready to answer their Cruel Ends.</p>
                     <p>So the Appealants seeing their illegal Proceedings, and that wrong Judgment proceeded from them that sate in the place of Justice, notwithstanding all that was said or spoken, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they cryed for Justice, they could not be heard; and if the Appealants Atturney (having no man else to plead for them) did speak any thing contrary to their Wills, either by

                     <p>Justice <hi>Whaley</hi> said at <hi>Newark</hi> Sessions to the Jury, That <hi>if they did believe that the</hi> Quakers <hi>did meet to</hi> MAKE MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIAGES <hi>or</hi> TURN PAN-GAKES, <hi>they might find it for the Appealant; but if to</hi> WORSHIP GOD, <hi>they might find it for the King.</hi>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:207826:62"/> Officers are forced to proceed in making Havock of their peaceable Neighbours Goods against their Consciences, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie those greedy Informers; as witness the aforesaid <hi>Pool</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, when he went with the Informer to the Meeting in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> the 16th of the 5th month, &amp; hearing the Truth declar'd, he cryed with Tears in his Eyes, <hi>VVhat shall I do?

                     </p>
                     <p>Note, John Crow <hi>would not suffer an Account to be taken of the Goods he &amp; the rest of them took away of</hi> Sam.
